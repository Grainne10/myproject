# My Project

**by Grainne Boyle**
I am a student at the [Atlantic Technological Universitiy] (https://www.atu.ie/), Galway, studying the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics on a part-time basis over 2 years.  This repository contains the files for  my submission of the project for the principles of data analytics module.

I work at [TE Connectivity] (https://www.te.com/usa-en/home.html). I am new to programming and coding .

# Overview

There are three files for this project:

* Penguins.ipynb - This file will show an analysis of the Palmer Penguin Dataset using Python code.
* Readme.md -  The Readme file accompanies the Jupyter notebook file . You should read this document first. It is a text file that contains information for the user about the software, project and code. It will contain instructions, links and references.
* GitIgnore - The gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. I have edited it and committed by hand when I had files that I wished to ignore. 

# Description

![Palmer Penguins Image] (https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/logo.png)

This project is based on the palmer penguins dataset.  The dataset is available [on GitHub] (https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)

The data for the Palmer Penguin project were collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman from 2007 to 2009. It was done by [Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/), part of the US Long Term Ecological Research Network. This network provides a long term view of the events that reshape ecosystems by making long observations publicly available, develop and maintain large scale experiments and train graduates in interdisciplinary collaborative team science.

The palmerpenguins data contains size measurements for each of the three penguin species: Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap. They were observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. It looks at size measurements and sex for 344 adult penguins.

A brief description on the three penguin species can be found at [Oceanwide Expeditions Blog](https://oceanwide-expeditions.com/blog/meet-all-6-antarctic-penguin-species)

Adélie penguin (Antarctica only) - Adelie are shallow divers and off shore foragers. There are an estimated 2.5 million breeding pairs of Adelie penguins in Antarctica. They weigh from 3.6 to 6.0 kg (7.9 to 13.2 pounds), grow between 46 to 71 cm (18 to 28 inches) tall.

Gentoo penguin (Antarctica and sub-Antarctic) - Gentoo are deep divers and in shore foragers. There are estimated to be about  300,000 breeding pairs of Gentoo penguins in the Antarctic region. As adults, gentoos are the third largest penguin behind emperors and kings, reaching 50 - 90 cm (19.7 - 35.4 inches) tall and weigh 4.5 - 8.5 kg (9.9 - 18.7 pounds). 
 
Chinstrap penguin (Antarctica and sub-Antarctic) - Adelie are shallow divers and off shore foragers. With roughly seven million pairs of chinstrap penguins in the world. They have an average height of 68 to 76 cm (27 to 30 inches) and weight between 3.2 to 5.3 kg (7.1 to 11.7 pounds).

[Penguin Species] (https://oceanwide-expeditions.com/blog/meet-all-6-antarctic-penguin-species) . This article explains about the different types of species and we learn about the general characteristics the penguins. 

[Long Term Ecological Research Network]( https://lternet.edu/) This explains the work done by this network.
[Statistics by Jim](https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/discrete-vs-continuous-data/) . This website explains clearly the difference between categorical and continuous variables.

## Comparisons to Other Work:
[Rpubs](https://rpubs.com/TEHoule/PalmerPenguinPlayground) - Published by Taylor 19.01.2023. This project had similar ideas to mine in displaying the correlation of the palmer penguins. They pull in the dataset and describe it. They start to build up the scatterplot using ggplot, they use different shapes and colours to show different visualisations. They do a line of best fit . They show a facet grid. Overall, the conclusion is similar to mine, quote"We have concluded that there is a strong positive correlation between the flipper length and the body mass of the penguins in the given data set. Furthermore, we have confirmed that this correlation is found across all three species . We created multiple visualization to support these findings and provided information on how these visualizations were created and used to support the analysis".

[Github Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html#highlights) - This shows an examle of a scatterplot of the relationship between flipper length and body mass, though variables are on different axis, the distribution is similar.

[Wikipedia Correlation Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) describes the linear relationship between x and y. It ranges from −1 to 1. If the value is close to +1 it implies that  if the data points are on a line as the x increases, the y also increases. If the value is close to – 1 , it implies a line where y increases while x decreases.
