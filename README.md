# My Project

**by Grainne Boyle**
I am a student at the [Atlantic Technological Universitiy] (https://www.atu.ie/), Galway, studying the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics on a part-time basis over 2 years.  This repository contains the files for  my submission of the project for the principles of data analytics module.

I work at [TE Connectivity] (https://www.te.com/usa-en/home.html). I am new to programming and coding .

# Overview

There are three files for this project:

* Penguins.ipynb - This file will show an analysis of the Palmer Penguin Dataset using Python code.
* Readme.md -  The Readme file accompanies the Jupyter notebook file . You should read this document first. It is a text file that contains information for the user about the software, project and code. It will contain instructions, links and references.
* GitIgnore - The gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. I have edited it and committed by hand when I had files that I wished to ignore. 

# Description

![Palmer Penguins Image] (https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/logo.png)

This project is based on the palmer penguins dataset.  The dataset is available [on GitHub] (https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)

The data for the Palmer Penguin project were collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman from 2007 to 2009. It was done by [Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/), part of the US Long Term Ecological Research Network. This network provides a long term view of the events that reshape ecosystems by making long observations publicly available, develop and maintain large scale experiments and train graduates in interdisciplinary collaborative team science.

The palmerpenguins data contains size measurements for each of the three penguin species: Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap. They were observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. It looks at size measurements and sex for 344 adult penguins.

A brief description on the three penguin species can be found at [Oceanwide Expeditions Blog](https://oceanwide-expeditions.com/blog/meet-all-6-antarctic-penguin-species)

Ad√©lie penguin (Antarctica only) - Adelie are shallow divers and off shore foragers. There are an estimated 2.5 million breeding pairs of Adelie penguins in Antarctica. They weigh from 3.6 to 6.0 kg (7.9 to 13.2 pounds), grow between 46 to 71 cm (18 to 28 inches) tall.

Gentoo penguin (Antarctica and sub-Antarctic) - Gentoo are deep divers and in shore foragers. There are estimated to be about  300,000 breeding pairs of Gentoo penguins in the Antarctic region. As adults, gentoos are the third largest penguin behind emperors and kings, reaching 50 - 90 cm (19.7 - 35.4 inches) tall and weigh 4.5 - 8.5 kg (9.9 - 18.7 pounds). 
 
Chinstrap penguin (Antarctica and sub-Antarctic) - Adelie are shallow divers and off shore foragers. With roughly seven million pairs of chinstrap penguins in the world. They have an average height of 68 to 76 cm (27 to 30 inches) and weight between 3.2 to 5.3 kg (7.1 to 11.7 pounds).
