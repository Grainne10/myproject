# My Project

**by Grainne Boyle**
I am a student at the [Atlantic Technological Universitiy] (https://www.atu.ie/), Galway, studying the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics on a part-time basis over 2 years. I am new to coding and it has been quite some time since I left college.

I work at [TE Connectivity] (https://www.te.com/usa-en/home.html). 

This Read Me file is to explain the project for the principles of data analytics module .

This project is based on the palmer penguins dataset.  The dataset is available [on GitHub] (https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)

The palmerpenguins data contains size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.
