# My Project

**by Grainne Boyle**
I am a student at the [Atlantic Technological Universitiy] (https://www.atu.ie/), Galway, studying the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics on a part-time basis over 2 years. I am new to programming and coding .

I work at [TE Connectivity] (https://www.te.com/usa-en/home.html). 

This Read Me file is to explain the project for the principles of data analytics module .

# Overview

There are three files for this project:

1) Penguins.ipynb - This file will show an analysis of the Palmer Penguin Dataset using Python code.
2) Readme.md -  The Readme file accompanies the Jupyter notebook file . You should read this document first. It is a text file that contains information for the user about the software, project and code. It will contain instructions, links and references.
3) GitIgnore - The gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore I have edited it and committed by hand when I had files that I wished to ignore. 

# Description

![Palmer Penguins Image] (https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/logo.png)

This project is based on the palmer penguins dataset.  The dataset is available [on GitHub] (https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)

The palmerpenguins data contains size measurements for each of the three penguin species: Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap. They were observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. It looks at Size measurements, clutch observations, and blood isotope ratios for 344 adult penguins. Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program.
